# 🕵️ Amazon Detective – Investigation & Forensics Layer

This folder implements **Amazon Detective** as the investigation engine of the security platform.  
Detective is used to analyze, correlate, and visualize security findings to understand *how* an attack happened, not just *that* it happened.

It works on top of:
- GuardDuty (threat signals)
- Security Hub (aggregation & governance)
